    Abstract:
      "Luna Care is a device designed to educate and assist young women in the management of cystitis and the proper use of antibiotics. Targeted at girls between the ages of 16 and 22, the device uses an LED interface to track menstrual cycle, monitor hydration, and manage antibiotic intake. Luna Care includes three components: Luna Portable  - smart speaker which contain LUNA character to provide the girl with her reliable friend and assistant. Smart bottle cup - Luna Aqua which tracks the water intake during the day and send the data to Luna. Luna Care includes an interactive widget that can be used on smartphones to provide real-time updates. Based on solid research, Luna Care aims to promote healthy habits and reduce antimicrobial resistance.",

    Project_goal:
      "The goal of the ecosystem is to educate young women and promote healthy behavior to prevent and manage urinary infections. Luna focuses on three key areas to promote healthy behavior and prevent urinary infections: Menstrual Cycle Monitoring: Luna Care helps women track their menstrual cycles, providing insights into their reproductive health. Hydration Management: Luna Care encourages regular water intake by sending reminders and tracking daily hydration levels. Pills / antibiotics Management: Luna prevent incorrect using of antibiotics and the self-treatment of UTI diseases",

    Research:
      "To better understand young people's habits and knowledge regarding antibiotic use and cystitis management, the following were conducted. We made an interview with Medical professionals, Conscious patient, Holistic medicine supporter and confident in self-treatment who is not aware of the antibiotic consequences. We also conducted desk research to understand the current problem in Europe related to antibiotics resistance. The need to educate young women about the symptoms of cystitis and the proper use of antibiotics was clear from the research. Early discontinuation of antibiotics is a common practice that contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance.",

The system, which included a thermal imaging camera set up at the entrance to the office, could scan employees' faces, recognize their identity based on name and department, and monitor their body temperatures. To ensure privacy, the system used machine learning trained on an internal database of employee photos, keeping all data strictly within the company’s local network, preventing any external data exposure. In cases where an employee’s body temperature exceeded 37.3°C, an alert was sent to reception staff, advising them to direct the employee to the medical office for COVID testing. The system would also notify the employee's direct supervisor, allowing for quick action to ensure workplace safety and minimize potential health risks.",
